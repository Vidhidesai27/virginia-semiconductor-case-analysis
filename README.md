# 📊 Virginia Semiconductor Case Study

This project presents a detailed regression-based case analysis of Virginia Semiconductor, exploring key drivers of customer purchase size, sales growth, and employee productivity. The project includes multiple regression models, statistical testing, and business recommendations.

## 🧠 Key Questions Explored
1. What factors influence the size of a customer’s purchase?
2. How do hours worked and the number of customers affect total sales?
3. What is the impact of workforce size on sales performance?

## 📈 Modeling Techniques
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Stepwise Regression
- Tukey’s Ladder of Transformations
- Multicollinearity Analysis (VIF)
- Residual and Diagnostic Checks
