This project presents a detailed regression-based case analysis of Virginia Semiconductor, exploring key drivers of customer purchase size, sales growth, and employee productivity. The project includes multiple regression models, statistical testing, and business recommendations.

## ðŸ§  Key Questions Explored
1. What factors influence the size of a customerâ€™s purchase?
2. How do hours worked and the number of customers affect total sales?
3. What is the impact of workforce size on sales performance?

## ðŸ“ˆ Modeling Techniques
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Stepwise Regression
- Tukeyâ€™s Ladder of Transformations
- Multicollinearity Analysis (VIF)
- Residual and Diagnostic Checks

## ðŸ“Š Project Files
- `Virginia Semiconductor_Case Study.pdf` â€“ Case background + questions
- `Case Study_Statistical Analysis.xlsx` â€“ All model calculations and regression outputs
- `README.md` â€“ Youâ€™re reading it!

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Linear Regression (Manual + Interpreted via formulas)

## ðŸ’¡ Summary of Findings
- **Company Size** is a significant predictor of customer purchase size
- **Hours Worked** and **Customer Count** significantly influence average sales
- The relationship between **Employees and Sales** is non-linear and benefits from transformation
- Model strength reached **94.8% RÂ²** in some cases
